# NFL Machine Learning Win Predictor

## Purpose

As a longtime fan of the NFL (Fly Eagles Fly!), I've always been curious about the real-time statistics and graphs that pop up every so often. The one that I've encountered the most was the win predictor, which never really seems to know who will truly win. 

## Project

I decided to make my own supervised learning machine learning that can use official NFL data as its labels and therefore make its own win prediction graph. More details about the project can be found within the Jupyter Notebook found in this repository.
